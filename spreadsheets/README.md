# `spreadsheets` folder

This is where the spreadsheets belong:

1. `abcd_fastqc01.txt` (the QC info)
1. `ABCD_good_bad_series_table.csv` (generated after `data_gatherer` is run)

The `abcd_fastqc01.txt` is currently available from the NDA. In a future update, this script will be updated to download that file and read from it instead of requiring the user to manually get the `abcd_fastqc01.txt` spreadsheet.
