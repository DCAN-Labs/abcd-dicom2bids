This data collection from the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Developmental Cognition and Neuroimaging (DCAN) Labs contains a regularly updated dataset of ABCD Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) version 1.2.0 pipeline inputs and derivatives. Source data are currently comprised of all the ABCD Study participants baseline year 1 arm 1 DICOM imaging data that passed initial acquisition quality control from the ABCD Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC) and were processed by OHSU DCAN Labs.

The input DICOM data to this BIDS version 1.2.0 (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644) data collection were retrieved from the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) share of ABCD fast-track data (https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=2573) and were last accessed on May 1, 2019. BIDS input data were converted from DICOMs using Dcm2Bids (https://github.com/cbedetti/Dcm2Bids). BIDS derivatives data were derived from the OHSU DCAN Labs ABCD-BIDS MRI processing pipeline which outputs Human Connectome Project (HCP) Minimal Preprocessing Pipelines-style data in both volume and surface spaces (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2587210, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.127). This collection is independent from ABCD Data Collection 2573. Users may access ABCD DICOM files via the ABCD fast-track imaging data release in Collection 2573.
