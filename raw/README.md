# `raw` folder

This folder will contain all of the raw files downloaded directly from the NDA website after `abcd2bids.py` is run. Other than this README, it does not need to contain anything before running `abcd2bids.py`. After running `abcd2bids.py`, this folder will contain one subdirectory for each ABCD subject session downloaded from the NDA.
